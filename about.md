Hi there. I'm Judd. This blog is about my journey to become a software developer.

<img style="width: 75%" src="/assets/judd_and_risden.jpg"/>

The quick of it is that I am a degreed and practicing mechanical engineer who spends his days designing and developing surgical instruments. While this has been a fun and exciting career, software has always been in the back of my mind. 

In late Feb of 2015 I decided to take the plunge and signed up for any coursera class I could find involving programming. I blitzed through [codeacedemy.com](http://www.codeacademy.com) and was looking for more. With some advice from some friends I dove into Ruby on Rails and have been teaching myself since.

I hope you find something on this blog interesting. 

Cheers!
