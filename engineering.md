## Medtronic Captain Hook Project - Dual Function Vessel Sealer

This product is the first of it’s kind. No other company has released a dual function device with this kind of utility. In mode 1, the device uses bipolar electrical energy between the jaws to seal vessels and tissue. A blade is used to bisect the sealed tissue. In mode 2, the device uses monopolar energy to cut and coagulate tissue that can’t be accessed with the jaws. The device has a deployable monopolar Hook that extends 1.35 inches and covers up the distal end of the device with a protective and electrically insulating sheath. When not in use it tucks away conveniently and the jaws of the device are then able to be used by the surgeon for general vessel sealing. This provides a great benefit to doctors because they do not have to exchange instruments during surgery but can instead press a paddle on the side of the device to switch between modes.
