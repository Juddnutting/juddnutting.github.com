### The Past
I don't really know what came over me this past winter. About 5 years ago I was in a crappy job situation and actually spoke to a admissions counselor at the local university. A master's in CS would be a great way to improve my skills and job prospects in a hot tech market. I even started learning Java from Standford's SEE online curriculum. A few months later I managed to get a way better job that was 4 miles from my house and so I dropped the pursuit of computer programming.

### The Present
Fast forward to February 2015. My wife and I purchased a town home and had moved in over Thanksgiving. Finally feeling settled I looked around at the career landscape and saw startups, software, and tech all around me. What I did not see was good local options for growth and other options in mechanical engineering. Don't get me wrong, I really enjoy my job, but I don't think I can stay there forever and where would I go next? We're not moving again. 

### Coursera
I decided I should re-open the door that lead to computer programming and see what was available now. In 5 years much had changed. Countless MOOC's teaching countless more courses from legit Universities! Free coding challenges and tutorials all over the Internet. I was hooked. I immediately signed up for a few classes on Coursera taught by Rice University.

* [An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python](https://www.coursera.org/course/interactivepython1)
* [Principles of Computing](https://www.coursera.org/course/principlescomputing1)

I took these concurrently knowing that I might have to drop the harder class and try again once I completed the first one. To my great surprise I was able to keep up in both classes and learned some really cool stuff.

In the first course we built a bunch of little games using an online Python interpreter built in JS called [CodeSkulptor](www.codeskulptor.org). Much of the graphics was taken care of for you but the core logic was the main challenge. The final project was a asteroids type game. You can play it [here](http://www.codeskulptor.org/#user39_4eqe5xRDn2_3.py). Just click the play arrow in the top left.

In PoC the intensity ramped up quite a bit and more complicated topics were discussed and implemented. Things like-

* [The 2048 Game](http://www.codeskulptor.org/#user39_EwuINvG0Mf_10.py)
* [Tic-Tac-Toe](http://www.codeskulptor.org/#user40_aHzVPcs6N6Cda4R_0.py) with AI using MonteCarlo Simulation and also an unbeatable Min-Max Algorithm
* A Breath First Search Algorithm
* Merge Sort and Recursion to create a [Word Wrangler](http://www.codeskulptor.org/#user39_FLID3XSYfOfs1YJ.py). Note - This is another students solution. Mine was a bit slow.

### TheOdinProject
I was hooked. At the same time I was plowing thru [TheOdinProject](www.theodinproject.com) which is a free online curriculum for learning Ruby on Rails. During the weekend I would try to finish all the assignments from both Coursera classes and then switch to learning Rails on TOP. I was busy but felt energized by all the new stuff I was learning.

### Drinking From The Firehose
There is a firehose of information out there. I was devouring as much as I could. Podcasts on programming and web development, blog after blog, python books from the library and much more. To say it is a bit overwhelming is an understatement. But I continue to march forward and learn as much as I can.
